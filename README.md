•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client for this project is The GamingRoom. They are interested in developing a web based game called, “Draw it or Lose it”, which was inspired by the game show “Win, lose, or draw.” The game was made to allow one or more teams compete by guessing what is being drawn from a library of images. The software requirements are the need to support multiple teams, have unique Identifiers, specific gaming structure, and be web based. 

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

What was done well in the documentation is its detailed description of the architecture, domain model, and design constraints. The design clarifies the requirements and constraints which makes it easier to develop the code based of the clients needs. 

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Having clear detailed description of the system architecture, model, and design constraints assisted in ensuring all requirements are met. A structured approach helped maintain a clear focus on each aspect of the software development process. Working through the document clarified the requirements, which made it easier to develop code that met the client’s needs. 

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise a section, it would be the evaluation section. It could be improved by providing more detailed analysis and adding additional data points. I would include in depth comparison between different platforms and maybe even include case studies. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the users’ needs, I focused on the core functionality of the game to make sure it is easy to use, scalable, and secure. This approach is crucial since it directly affect the usability of the software. 

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached the software design by analyzing the requirements thoroughly. Also, I made sure to identify constraints and potential challenges. This ensured that the design is functional and efficient. 
I would use end user feedback and incorporate it in the process for future strategies. Also, using more modular design approach to make the software easier to scale and maintain.
